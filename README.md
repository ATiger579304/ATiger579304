- 👋 Hi, I’m Martin Silvey
- 👀 I’m interested in opportunities as a Programmer
- 🌱 I’ve been coding since the early 80's. I started with BASIC on a Commodore64/128. Then on to PASCAL, FORTRAN and AS400 RPG in college.
    After college, I started in Mainframe COBOL --> AS400 COBOL/RPG --> PHP.
    As a self-proclaimed nerd, I learned VB.NET for a personal project in the late 90's, and this turned into a full website once I picked up PHP.
    I am currently learning Python in hopes of becoming a full fledged Python Programmer.
    I love coding and all of the intricacies involved. I am a puzzles guy, and troubleshooting is my forte.
