- 👋 Hi, I’m Martin Silvey
- 👀 I’m interested in opportunities as a Programmer
- 🌱 I’ve been coding since the early 80's. I started with BASIC on a Commodore64/128. Then on to PASCAL, FORTRAN and AS400 RPG in college.
    After college, I started in Mainframe COBOL --> AS400 COBOL/RPG --> PHP.
    As a self-proclaimed nerd, I learned VB.NET for a personal project in the late 90's, and this turned into a full website once I picked up PHP.
    I am currently learning Python in hopes of becoming a full fledged Python Programmer.
    I love coding and all of the intricacies involved. I am a puzzles guy, and troubleshooting is my forte.
    My top quote as a Programmer with 26+ years experience is "If you can't put it on paper, then you don't know what you have."
    I believe documentation is key. If you don't take care of it properly up front, then you have to do it the hard way at the end.
    I'm not being negative with this statement. Lack of documentation and being able to do it properly has been a big part of my career.
    No programming language or application has ever hindered my ability to excel in any IT Project.
